In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Logistic Regression is one of the most applied algorithms in industry:\n",
    "  > Logistic regression is used in weather forecasting, for example, to not\n",
    "only predict if it will rain on a particular day but also to report the chance of rain.\n",
    "Similarly, logistic regression can be used to predict the chance that a patient has a\n",
    "particular disease given certain symptoms, which is why logistic regression enjoys\n",
    "wide popularity in the field of medicine.\n",
    "  > <cite>[1]</cite>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Strengths:**   \n",
    "    * Very easy to implement \n",
    "    * Easily updated, which is attractive when working with streaming data.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "  * **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    * It requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results.\n",
    "    * Since it tries to maximize the conditional likelihood of the target given the training data, it's more prone to outliers than SVMs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "  * **Justification for choosing the model**:\n",
    "     \n",
    "    * Even knowing befohand that we don't actually have a set of independent variables ( features ), since a lot of them are correlated to each other, the use of logistic regression model seemed reasonable since it works very well in classification problems and it's simple enough to try at first ( Occam's Razor ). It's always possible to make further optimizations in real problems -- such as Dimensionality Reduction to deal with covariant features -- if necessary or apply more complex models.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Random Forests**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Applications**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * It's used in financial institutions to predict loyal/fraudulent customers.\n",
    "    * **Pharmacology**: It's used in pharmacology to validade the correct combination of components in drug analysis<cite>[2]</cite>\n",
    "    * **E-Commerce**: Decision Trees are widely used in e-commerce. It's used to generate online catalog, which is essential for the success of an e-commerce web site.<cite>[3]</cite>\n",
    "    * **Medicine**: It's used in medicine as a helper in diagnostics given the medical record of the patient.<cite>[4]</cite>\n",
    "    * It was used in Microsoft's XBox Kinnect tool to identify player's body parts.<cite>[5]</cite>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Strengths**: \n",
    "  \n",
    "    * It can be used for both Classification and Regression\n",
    "    * It handles missing values and maintains accuracy for missing data   \n",
    "    * It handles large data set with higher dimensionality\n",
    "    * We don't have to worry so much about choosing hyperparameters values \n",
    "    * We typically don't need to prune the random forest since the ensemble is quite robust to noise from the individual tree.<cite>[1]</cite>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Weaknessess**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    * Good Job at Classification but not as good as for Regression, because it doesn't give a precise and continuous nature of prediction, i.e, it doesn't generalize well beyond the training data.\n",
    "    * May overfit particularly noisy data.\n",
    "    * You have very little control on what the model does. It has a black-box approach\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Justification for Using the Model**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * After the preprocessing, we have a big number of binary features, so it makes sense to use a Binary Decision Tree. But Random Forest was chosen instead of just a Decision Tree because of the strengths enumerated above, mainly to prevent overfitting because of the higher number of features.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Support Vector Machines**  \n",
    "  * **Applications**: <cite>[6]</cite>\n",
    "    \n",
    "     * Text Categorisation\n",
    "     * Image Recognition\n",
    "     * Aspect Independent Classification\n",
    "     * Colour-Based Classification\n",
    "     * Hand-written Digit Recognition\n",
    "     * Bioinformatics\n",
    "     * Protein Homology Detection\n",
    "     * Gene Expression      \n",
    "       \n",
    "  * **Strengths**: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * It converges even if the data is non-linearly separable.\n",
    "    * Performs non-linear classification problems using the kernel trick\n",
    "    * It's effective in high dimensional spaces\n",
    "    * We can use different kernels or combinations of kernels and have more complex separating hyperplanes\n",
    "    * Are not affected by local minima\n",
    "    * Do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Weaknesses**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Poor performance when #features > # samples.\n",
    "    * SVMs do not provide probability estimates\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Justification for Using the Model**: It may be the case that the classes in the independent variable are not linearly separable or not even linear in the first place. So it's natural to use a SVM with a non-linear kernel to prevent underfitting. SVMs are robust and a more complex tool to apply so we have a good balance between a simpicity ( Logistic Regression ) and complexity.\n",
